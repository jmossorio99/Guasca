# Simulation of MIO buses in the city of Cali

In this project we aim to simulate the movements of several buses in the city of Cali, Colombia in a defined time interval. The user is also able to visualize a map of the city and to select if they want to see only stops, stations or both and in which specific zone. The simulate option will take in a time interval defined by the user or if the fields are left blank, the program will just run on a predefined time interval. The buses will show in green if they are active or in red if they are wasting time. The user can also filter the zones he wants to see simulated.
